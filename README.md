# ToDo-App
Sample ToDo app using React and SemanticUI

Tech:
- React
- SemanticUI

Possible Tech additions:
- Redux
- Node.js
- SQL
- Docker

Features:
- Add new Boards to seperate todos relevant to their needs
- Add/remove new todos
- Redo/remove completed todos
- Rename/remove boards

Future work:
- Add proper styling (needs more time than designing app functionality itself)
- Adding regex support for user input validation
- Adding authentication/authorization
- Adding session support
- Add state management support to the app (avoided redux since not needed)
- Add a backend server
- Design DB schema relevant to the data structure being used in app to maintain global state
- Try to limit DB write-calls from backend APIs to improve performance
- Add compatibility to other platforms
